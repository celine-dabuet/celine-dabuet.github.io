        <p>"Kia ora koutou! I'm Celine, I was born in Philippines and grew up in Wellington in my early teens. For the past 5 years, I have been constantly going against the grain of my identity and diving into things I normally would be too scared to get into. Whether that's committing myself to a career into tech, or finding the courage to run outside and not worry about what people think (I've successfully ran the round the bays 8.4km so lots of progress in this area!). I'm here in DevAcademy because I love the focus on people rather than fully on skill, and that gave me encouragement that I don't have to be the best (but I'm trying!!!), so long as I can work in a team. As a true introvert, I am quite surprised to find I do enjoy working in teams." - 20 February 2025, 4:53pm </p>
