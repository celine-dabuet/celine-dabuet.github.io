      <h2>Foundations</h2>
      <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">To become a full-stack web developer. I'm mainly keen on the front-end side of the website but I know eventually when I master something, I will look for other ways to improve, hence the goal to become a full-stack developer.</p>

      <h4>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">I enjoy learning new things and I would like to think I learn things easily, however, my biggest limitation is procrastination.</p>

      <h4>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">On the technical side, I would like to develop more discipline and to retain more information. I would like to focus on learning key concepts and be more confident on applying it, rather than relying on copy & paste code.</p>
      <p class="main-body">On the human skills, I would like to be able to provide useful feedback to my peers, and to better my communication skills especially when it involves technical topics.</p>

      <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">Starting tomorrow (3 March 2025), I would like to wake up at 4am and commit 2 hours in the morning to studying. I've done this before and I know it's helped so much with my productivity levels. At bare minimum, it's to show up everyday to my sprints for at least 2 hours. Over the weekend, I would like to commit a full 16 hours, and to revisit topics I would like to dive deeper on.</p>

      <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">After exhausting all my resources and brainpower on Google, I would look into Discord and go under the help channels to see if anyone has raised my problem. It also helps to be able to see other people's work as it has helped me well when making my website - something I didn't expect to be helpful. Finally, reach out to my peers and facilitators. It's very stressed to myself that I need to give the people I've asked help from appropriate time to help me. I have been lucky so far to be able to solve my own problems, but as it gets more complex, it will be critical to do the work earlier so I can ask for help earlier.</p>

      <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">It would be a dream to receive help within 10 minutes. But if not, I expect the Facilitation team to provide timely answers at least within an hour, if not, then first thing the following day.</p>

      <h4>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">Fortunately, my work allows me to be flexible, however, if I'm to be protective and strict of my time, these would be:
        <ol>
          <li>Work hours - 7:30am-5:00pm</li>
          <li>Family time - Sundays 6:00pm-10:00pm </li>
          <li>Cooking schedule - 3x/week 5:00-7:00pm</li>
          <li>Gym commitments - 2x/week 5:00pm-7:00pm</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
      <h4>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        My answer is still the same: to become a full-stack web developer. I found out there is an opportunity internally that will open up in the future and something I didn't expect to happen that perfectly aligns with what I have been doing so far.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        My biggest strengths will be committing to my coding partner. I'm someone who cares about my impact on others so this is something I'm confident about. My biggest limitation is being able to contribute meaningfully programming-wise.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        Being able to stick to a well-timed and planned studying routine.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        Being able to fully embrace the struggle of learning and of 'not yet'.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        Timely help and support which I can see is already being done. I would also appreciate if there could be plenty more of revision lessons on live in the evenings.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        I expect myself to be more disciplined and attentive to my programming partner.
