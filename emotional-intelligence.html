      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence? </h4>
      <p class="main-body">Emotional Quotient (EQ), or better known as Emotional Intelligence, covers two main areas: our emotions and other people's emotions. The first part of EQ is the awareness of your own emotions as they happen, understanding the reasons why the emotions arise, and the ability of managing and controlling the emotions. The second part of EQ is being able to recognize other people's emotions, understand the underlying reasons and motivations behind people's emotions, and the ability to influence their emotions. </p>

      <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">Intellectual Quotient (IQ) is a number that shows a person's overall cognitive ability. The numerical result is measured from problem-solving tests and it includes processing, knowledge, reasoning, and memorizing factors. In comparison to EQ, instead of quantitative (numerical) measures of intelligence, EQ is measured in qualitative (descriptive) measure of intelligence. It is the person's feelings, thoughts and behaviors. IQ is about comprehending information, whereas EQ is about interpreting information. </p>

      <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">EQ is so important because it affects our perception of the world, helps us navigate hardships and positively affects our relationships. Emotions positively or negatively highlight something within us and it directs our attention to it. As Daniel Goleman states, "Our attention creates our reality." For example if we are in love, the world seems kind and serene, but if we are angry, the world seems to be against us. So if we can be consciously aware of our emotions, especially of negative emotions, and we are able to analyze the reasons behind it, we can change our perception and attitudes, and therefore change the trajectory of our reality. Instead of obstacles, we see opportunities; instead of rejection, we see the need for improvement. And as we progress in life with more knowledge of ourselves, we will be able to relate more to other people and create a stronger sense of empathy that removes us from simply reacting to situations and people, but to be mindful of the reality each person is living in. </p>
