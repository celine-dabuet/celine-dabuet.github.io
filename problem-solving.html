      <h4>Blocked on a simple problem</h4>
      <p class="main-body">The simple problem I had was figuring why the solution I provided wasn't accepted. Regardless of providing the correct answer, the test failed me and this was a real mystery because it was a good reminder that no matter how confident I was about my code, there was something that could be wrong. Checking the logic of my code line by line was always the first thing I did; making sure there were no typos, accidental capitalization or lack thereof of my wording, dissecting each code and making sure I understood every single character I used. It was really frustrating solving this simple problem because I found this specific challenge to be a breeze to do and I quickly understood how the built-in methods in Javascript are supposed to be used, so to be stumped on why the test was failing me was mind-boggling. Upon checking the questions and staring at the checking requirements for a long period of time that  it was then that I realised I wasn't fulfilling the requirements of the question on <em>how</em> the solution is provided. In coding, there are different ways to print a result onto the console/browser. First, there is the straightforward, <strong>console.log()</strong> method, and second there is the <strong>return</strong> keyword. In this case, I constantly did the former rather than the latter option. I learned that carefully understanding all the components of the question is really important as it's not always about giving the correct answer but <em>how</em> it's given.</p>

      <h4>Elegantly solved a problem</h4>
      <p class="main-body">A very peculiar question as I have no idea how I can <i>elegantly</i> solve a problem. I don't know if there's anything elegant in glaring at a screen and talking loudly at a notebook. But in terms of making the code more sophisticated, I have learned the shorthand way of writing functions using the <b>arrow =></b> method. I'm still wrapping my head around it fully but I realised that I should aim to make my code as short as possible and as less-hard-coded as I can make it. When I was able to use this shorthand version in the Javascript Kata challenge, I think the code looked quite dashing seeing it in its most succinct form.</p>

Only 3 stars because I find myself getting a bit lost and overcomplicating things, therefore, losing precious time. Although a bit tedious to do, it is good for discovering why something is the more preferred technique.</td>

            <td>I do love doing the rubber ducky method but because I heavily rely on visual learning (needing to see it to understand), I relied on my jotting down concepts on my notebook frequently while speaking out loud. It helps me see the relationships between the code, dig deeper with each concept, and a good way to strengthen the "bridge" of learning we learned about in neuroplasticity. I found that I tend to do this the most aggressive when I'm really stuck on a code. I'm giving it 5 stars as my favourite method to learn. </td>

            <td>I do find the error messages useful in pinpointing whereabouts in the code I'm having errors in but I think I could be better in reading it. If there is a whole list of error messages, I tend to just glaze over it and move on to a different method of debugging.</td>

            <td>This method is my most favourite in debugging because it gives me vision on what is happening to the data. Ironically, this strong favour for console.logging() everything has gotten me into trouble when I should be using the return keyword instead. Otherwise, this is my go-to method of debugging every step of the way.</td>

            <td>Googling has been useful in seeing the different articles to explain a concept. But I should really say ChatGPT has saved me as I find it the most useful in providing examples on how to use a method for example, or to tell it to explain to me what is this method, etc. It feels like having a personal tutor. But because there is a risk for incorrect answers, I use it hand-in-hand with Google and finding other articles to back up the explanations in ChatGPT. I am not quite confident in sifting through results on stackoverflow so I sometimes find it overwhelming when I'm given so many answers that are not tailored to what I'm looking for. I have realized that the trick is to find bits of pieces of code to be the most effective. </td>

There were multiple times where I was stuck on a question no one had raised and so I take that as this should be simple enough for me to do on my own so I challenge myself further to see if I can do it myself (luckily I'm surviving so far).</td>

      <h4>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        I felt reluctant to ask for help because firstly I have fallen behind quite a bit on the Sprints so I didn't think it was good (or deserved) to be helped now when I'm quite late. I know the facilitators don't think this but it's more of a punishment on myself for procrastinating. Time is really of the essence, with the bootcamp coming up, I really would like to challenge myself to do better on completing tasks very early on. Ironically, I love studying once I get into it but the mood to start studying is the real challenge. What I might try next time is just studying in the living room where my family is because I really hate isolating myself in my room to "focus." This is what I'm doing right now and I'm quite impressed with the progress I've made in just having my computer open whereever I am as long as I have my noise-cancelling headphones on of course üòÅ.
