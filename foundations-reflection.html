      <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        <ol>
          <li>
            My motivation to start things are not reliable at all, but once I get into learning and coding, I really appreciated knowing that I do enjoy programming.</li>
          <li>
            My favourite Human Skills topic was about Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset. Being introduced to the idea of 'not yet' helped in embracing the learning process. Discovering the advice of coding everyday is actually scientifically backed. The bridges between our brain cells that are strengthened everytime we do and learn deeper about something was really helpful in visualizing how our brain develops.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learned that my ego strongly correlates to the effort I put. For example, because I tend to procrastinate about (I'm really sorry facilitators), I don't think I deserve to be helped because of this significant flaw. I know this flaw will change during the bootcamp because I'm very aware of my impact on others and wouldn't want to dampen my peers progress because of this.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h4>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Our values can dictate the way we create code and deal with the many problems and set-back we deal with coding. For example, despite of my procrastination, because I value that I understand what I'm learning, it's not enough to simply write the code and move on. I need to understand how it works before anything else. Values help guide our actions and motivations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Empathy in programming is understanding that everyone learns at different paces and everyone is dealing with life. Empathy also helps in how a code is completed such as making it easier for others to understand your code via comments, DRY techniques so that it's clean. Creating websites that are easily accessible shows the concern for how others will experience it. It's important during coding collaborations and there is plenty of this in the coding world.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-awareness in programming means as a way of constantly growing to be better not just as a programmer but also to ourselves. Taking the time to step away from a problem and to take care of oneself actually does help. There were many times in the founcations course that I did this, even just a 15 minutes break made me realise what I needed to do to solve something. Understanding how I work will definitely be useful for when bootcamp starts because I realised that I don't need to lock myself in a room. I much prefer to work with others around me. 
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h4>
        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        How I actually look forward to the reflection questions the Sprint will have and I enjoyed it as much because it gives us a break from solving code.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        I found the looping exercise with another pair the most challenging as I didn't enjoy having to reach out to a stranger. But upon completing it, I found it to be a pleasant experience with lots of laughs and quirky moments.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        Other learning institutions often overlooked this aspect and from what I remember, DevAcademy has been told by employers that these Human Skills are something they heavily consider. It's something I really appreciate because DevAcademy is putting human nature back in a world that is of machines and technology. Programs are made by people for people, and it's important to understand how different persons have different cultures and values, and these differences should be respected.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h4>
      <p class="main-body">
        No, it's not a waste of time. Being forced to think and reflect by publishing blogs help slow down the mind and remind the student that there is more to code than just knowing syntax and logic. It influences how code is created, if it is user-friendly, and also a good reminder to the student that learning takes time. It is difficult but it's not impossible. The Human Skills section help take away the scariness from coding and that coding is not just for smart people, it's for everyone willing to put the work in.
