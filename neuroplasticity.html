      <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">Neuroplasticity broken down into two words are:</p>
        <ul class="main-body">
          <li>Neural = relating to the nerve or nervous system</li>
          <li>Plasticity = capacity to be modifiable or altered</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="main-body">Therefore, neuroplasticity is the term to describe the brain's ability to be changed. In technical terms, it is the process in which the brain forms new neurons and bridge connections between other neurons. This happens when the brain is introduced to new things and is repeatedly practised which leads to a change in the brain. What this tells us is that the old belief that after a certain age, the brain becomes fixed and is harder to change overtime; that our intelligence, characteristics, habits and physical abilities cannot be changed or improved. However, we now know this is not the case. Through practice and repetition, we can change our old ways and still learn new things regardless of age. The most important thing to remember is that we can only change through experience or practice. By 'doing' are we only able to change and achieve the things we once thought were hard or even impossible. From this, it's safe to say that the principles we've learned from neuroplasticity give people hope that they can be better at what they do, learn anything they are interested in and even complete the road to full physical recovery after an accident. It is extremely beneficial to people to know about neuroplasticity because our beliefs significantly affect the things we do in life. If we believe that we cannot change, then we have already lost the battle before we even tried. If we remember that we can grow, even at an old age, then the possibilities in life become endless. It's now just up to us when we want to stop trying or learning.</p>

      <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. </h4>
      <p class="main-body">Without knowing about the research in being able to "re-wire" ourselves, I realize that I was already doing it. I was always told I was dumb at math and so that led me to believe I suck at everything that involves numbers so I stayed as far away as I can from anything involving numbers and stuck with the arts. Because of that, I made a mistake of not taking up computer science in university only because it had something to do with numbers. Admittedly, I do struggle with mental math but when I started my personal journey on financial literacy, I found out my passion for financial independence and financial goal settings. I enjoyed learning about investments, the importance of saving, and even benefits of credit cards if done right. If I didn't challenge myself to go against those self-limiting beliefs I also wouldn't be a student at Dev Academy. Now the next challenge is to apply the principle of practice and repetition to learn JavaScript. Now that I know what I've been doing these past years is scientifically proven, I feel even more hopeful that I can challenge those pre-determined traits such as hereditary characteristics, or in simple terms, I have weak bones due to my environment growing up, but in actuality, that's only because I've never really used them and if I wanted to be stronger, I should make the effort to exercise more. The quotes I would like to take away from this is "Practice makes permanent," and "Confidence is displayed ability."</p>

      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">1. Use it or lose it – consistent practice to ensure that the bridges between the neurons continue to be fed with experience, otherwise, skipping weeks will lead back to square one. 
        <br><br> 2. Repetition – doing the same skill repeatedly aims to put the learning from short-term memory to long-term memory. 
        <br><br> 3. Intensity – to further improve neuroplasticity, it's one thing to repeat a skill, but it's another thing to challenge the brain or body. "No pain, no gain" is a real thing not that just at the gym, but for whenever we learn something. Successfully solving difficult questions is just the type of activity our brain needs to develop. In saying that, there is a limit to when problems are unsolvable so it's also important to know when to ask for help.</p>

      <h4>Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">Growth mindset is having the belief that ones' capabilities can be developed and/or improved through diligence and feedback. In addition, challenges and obstacles are perceived as opportunities of growth and sources of learnings. Having a growth mindset is important especially in challenging times because it helps people reframe the problem they are facing. Instead of being disappointed of the skills they lack to solve a problem, those with growth mindset find creative ways to the solution or are given insight on a skill they need to work on. Growth mindset is relevant in this mind set exploration because this frame of mind complements the process of neuroplasticity. By putting ourselves in situations that positively challenge our beliefs, it stimulates the brain, building new neurons and more connections. </p>

      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p class="main-body">As I read more about the growth mindset, I did find it insightful that growing as a better person and employee also relies on the feedback we receive from other people, and being able to take that constructive criticism to develop better processes or strategies for ourselves. It reminds me of the motivational self-development saying by James Clear that in order to achieve greatness, we should strive to be better by 1% everyday. Another thing that made a significant positive impact on my perspective to learning is the power of "Yet." I wished this way of grading was introduced to when I was young so that when I learned mathematics, it was just a "yet" moment and not a lifetime of failure. </p>

      <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? </h4>
      <p class="main-body">As we are currently learning in JavaScript, I'm mentally prepared that it's going to be hard, but the reall challenge is when I'm in the situation of problem-solving the code. I have seen on Discord that people are finding the exercises in Sprint 4 really difficult so that's something I'm trying to prepare for. By emulating a growth mindset in this coding journey, I would like to take the problems I face in Dev Academy as a chance to push my boundaries and to eventually better myself as a person and developer. </p>
