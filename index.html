        <p>Kia ora koutou! I'm Celine, I was born in the Philippines and grew up in Wellington in my early teens. For the past 5 years, I have been constantly going against the grain of my identity and diving into things I normally would be too scared to get into. Whether that's committing myself into a career into tech, or finding the courage to run outside and not worry about what people think <i>(I've successfully ran the round the bays 8.4km so lots of progress in this area!)</i>. I'm here in DevAcademy because I love the focus on people rather than fully on skill, and that gave me encouragement that I don't have to be the best <i>(but I'm trying!!!)</i>, so long as I can work in a team. As a true introvert, I am quite surprised to find I do enjoy working in teams. </p>
