      <h4>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </h4>
      <p class="main-body">I'm not sure if this counts as an ethical decision, however, I did have to make a difficult decision on a financial problem. It was the choice of whether to help out my family or keep the money to reach big financial goals with my partner. I know that helping out my family would provide me peace of mind, but that would potentially set-back the plans I have with my partner of a couple of years. Many times in my life when coming onto crossroads, I tend to think of "why not both?" I truly believe that there doesn't have to be a painful compromise because there is always a way to make both things work. I found myself listing out my points of concerns and discussing each point with my family and partner to ensure I have thought about all the possible things that the decision may come with. During these discussions, it has been quite easy keeping myself separate from the heightened emotions that arise from my family and my partner because I value their concerns and I know all of their concerns are valid. I found that resolving each concern has been quite exciting because it shows me that there are ways to make things happen, things that I did not consider before and are just now finding out.</p>

      <h4>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">I grew up in the Philippines therefore I have a strong sense of respecting my elders and community welfare. The people around me have taught me contrasting values to my culture of an almost non-existing hiearachy and strong sense of individuality. These opposing influences in my life have moulded me to be respectful with a strong sense of inner-direction. I am someone who finds value in contributing to the community as much as I can, whether it is about collaborative teamwork at work or discussing goals with my family, whilst ensuring that I have strong sense of self in terms of what I like to do, my own goals and dreams and being aware of my boundaries.</p>

      <h4>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">If I had to list my top 3 strengths, they would be: 
        <ol>
          <li>Adaptability – I am comfortable in new environments and learning new processes. This will help me in my learning because finding new things are quite exciting and new knowledge is always welcome.</li>
          <li>Integrity – whatever I do, it's important for me to complete or do things that doesn't diminish my sense of self, and being honest with myself is top priority. This will help me in my learning by ensuring my work is done to the best of my ability. </li>
          <li>Empathy – I find it very easy to understand others emotions, therefore this will be helpful during collaborative work. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey? </h4>
      <p class="main-body">I tend to doubt myself if I am good enough which have set me back a couple of times in my career development. So in times I get stuck with problem-solving in code, I may start to lose motivation because I start to think I am not smart enough to learn this so let alone have a career in it.</p>

      <h4>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
      <p class="main-body">I was tasked to work on a large data management job and to delegate people on completing it. Because of my ineffective training and because I tend to have a laidback approach that they will ask for help if they need it, and so I think that made people slack-off on doing the job. I have now employed a tracker to keep everyone accountable, and to actively ask if people have any questions. To help continue productivity, I will employ a strategy of check-ins every start of the week to see where we are and how we're tracking as a group in completing the project.</p>
